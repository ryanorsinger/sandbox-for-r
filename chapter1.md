![](pipeline.png)

Pipeline:
- import
- tidy
- repeat
  - transform
  - visualize
  - model
- communicate

R4DS plan
- small, rectangular, in-memory datasets
- use https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table for Big Data

## Hypotheiss Generation vs. Confirmation 
- R4DS is focused on hypothesis generation, data exploration

## How to install and import a library
- `install.packages("tidyverse")`
- `library(tidyverse)`
- `install.packages(c("nycflights13", "gapminder", "Lahman"))`

## Helpful things
- reprex: a minimal reproducible example
- `mtcars` loads a global dataset
- dput(mtcars) 

## Chapter 2
>  Data exploration is the art of looking at your data, rapidly generating hypotheses, quickly testing them, then repeating again and again and again. The goal of data exploration is to generate many promising leads that you can later explore in more depth.

"In this part of the book you will learn some useful tools that have an immediate payoff"
- Visualization
- Data transformation
- Exploratory data analysis
